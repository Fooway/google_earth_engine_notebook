    "Dealing with imagery from different times can be difficult. Since different images were taken on different days and mosaics can be stiched together from images taken at different times, you usually need to select images taken on a *range* of dates to stich together an entire area. If you want to see an area change over time you have to select different date ranges that 1) provide 100% coverage of the area of interest and 2) do not overlap, since then you would be comparing two mosaics possibly made up of the same images.\n",
